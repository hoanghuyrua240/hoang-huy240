Write code as if the next developer is a psychopath who knows where you live.A codebase is a garden; it requires constant maintenance."Temporary" workarounds become permanent."It’s not a bug, it’s a feature!"It’s not just a job, it’s an obsession.The best part of coding is watching it work.Code like there is no tomorrow.When in doubt, refactor.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.A day of debugging can save you an hour of planning.Whitespace matters.Code like there is no tomorrow.There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.Syntax matters. Ask anyone who’s used Python.Real developers don’t need Stack Overflow… said no developer ever.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException.I’d rather be coding.Git happens.Real programmers count from 0.If it ain’t broke, improve it until it is.python.py
